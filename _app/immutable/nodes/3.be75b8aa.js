During the pandemic, I created my first mobile app called 1Mark Mastery. At the time, I saw how difficult it was to send guides and study material across platforms, so I built an app to help. I immediately published it, and it ended up reaching more than 100 students. That moment — realizing I could use technology to solve a real problem and help people — was the spark that started it all.</p>',te,j,f,U,se,ae,k,_,z,T,oe,pe,B,Se='<h2 class="svelte-1fwkte4">Chasing Curiosity</h2> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">I&#39;m driven, curious, and weirdly calm under pressure. I go by the motto &quot;It is what it is&quot; and push through whatever comes my way. I often pull all-nighters when I get curious about something and just can&#39;t sleep until I figure it out. Whether it&#39;s a last-minute hackathon or a product pitch for a startup idea, I&#39;m there with a whiteboard, a roadmap, and an open Figma tab.</p>',ge,me,P,S,W,He='<h2 class="svelte-1fwkte4">My Work in Tech</h2> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">I build applications that solve problems, educate, and simplify lives. My motivation is simple: I want to build cool things that people can use every day. That drive has taken me through a wide spectrum of tech — I&#39;ve become well-versed in everything from embedded systems to mobile apps, web platforms, AI tools, and even game development. I enjoy learning about new fields and picking up the tools I need along the way.</p> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">I&#39;ve never wanted to be limited to just one domain — I love wearing many hats, exploring new tools, and blending disciplines to create something meaningful. Right now, I&#39;m especially interested in leveraging AI to automate processes and enhance productivity. I&#39;m deep-diving into tools like Cursor AI and exploring how intelligent systems can support both developers and non-tech folks.</p>',we,K,M,ie,ye,Ie,G,H,A,Ve='<h2 class="svelte-1fwkte4">Beyond Code</h2> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">Outside of tech, I play badminton regularly and love the energy it brings. I&#39;m also really into hiking — the longest one I&#39;ve done was the Half Dome hike, which took 12 hours and left me with memories I&#39;ll never forget. I love chess as well and enjoy the quiet strategy behind it.</p> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">And yes, I have an artsy side too. I dabble in graphic design for my clubs, and I&#39;m obsessed with pixel art — something about its simplicity and retro charm gets me every time. If I weren&#39;t in tech, I&#39;d probably be a designer, blending visuals with stories that speak.</p>',be,Q,C,ne,ke,_e,O,V,X,D,re,Te,q,Le='<h2 class="svelte-1fwkte4">Leading to Teach</h2> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">One of the things I care deeply about is teaching others how to code. I&#39;m the President of the Google Developer Student Club, Co-founder and Director of the Swift Coding Club, and Vice President of Software at SacHacks — all roles I&#39;ve taken on with a single purpose: to give people a space where they can learn, build, and grow together.</p> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">GDSC and Swift Coding Club now support over 150 developers working on projects and learning the foundations of software development. At SacHacks, I helped create an environment where over 400 developers built and launched projects within 24 hours. Across these communities, I&#39;ve hosted more than 20 workshops covering different areas of coding — from mobile development to cloud integration — all with the goal of making tech more accessible and exciting for everyone.</p>',Me,Ce,N,L,J,$e='<h2 class="svelte-1fwkte4">The Big Picture</h2> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">At the end of the day, I&#39;m just someone who genuinely loves the process of building — not just the code, but the people and the purpose behind it. Whether it&#39;s designing a sensor-driven security system, developing an educational mobile app, or growing a supportive community of student developers, I find joy in creating things that matter.</p> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">My goal has always been to bridge passion with practicality, and help others do the same. Every line of code, every workshop, and every idea shared is a small piece of a much bigger vision: to make tech feel human, collaborative, and empowering for anyone who&#39;s willing to try.</p> <p class="svelte-1fwkte4">Thanks for reading a bit about me. Feel free to check out my projects, reach out, or just say hi — I&#39;m always up for building something exciting with passionate people.</p>',De,Y,E,le,Ee,je,I;return h=new

			<br><br>
			Our project was built using a combination of JavaScript and React for the front-end, while Python and Flask were utilized for the back-end. We selected these languages and libraries because of their ease of use, making the development process more streamlined. We integrated the OpenAI API and the Hume AI to power our AI interviewer. This combination allowed our system to generate appropriate responses, guide users during interviews, and improve its feedback through learning. The Hume AI component was instrumental in analyzing the users' emotions during their responses, enhancing the overall user experience and feedback provided by our AI interviewer. Utilizing the OpenAI API, we generated contextually relevant and coherent responses aligned with the user's inputs and interview scenarios, making the interview experience more realistic and practical.`,

Using the TI CC3200 Launchpad, I developed a security system that leveraged an IR remote receiver and a PIR sensor to detect motion. When unauthorized motion was detected, the system would send an alert via AWS SNS email notifications while simultaneously logging events into an AWS database. The most difficult part was debugging communication between the IR sensor and the microcontroller, ensuring that false positives were minimized. This project deepened my understanding of SPI, I2C, and AWS cloud integration. Seeing the system function in real-time, triggering alerts with precision, was both fun and incredibly rewarding!",
